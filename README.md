* Note from the author: This is quite inefficient because it's based on a not-currently-working build of the ranked voting system.
It's essentially the ranked voting program with some functionality (and the lack of it functioning correctly) removed.
* Needs editing - all previous votes can be seen and if a name is spelled incorrectly, the program quits.
